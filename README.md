# React Native Mobile Chat App
In this mobile app, there is a start page for users to enter their name, choose a background color and a button to start chatting.  
The button links the users to the second page where they are able to see their conversation, type in an input box and submit new messages.  
Users are also able to send images and location data.  All data gets stored online and offline.
